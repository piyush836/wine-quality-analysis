# Wine Quality EDA

This project explores the Wine Quality (Red Wine) dataset using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

## Dataset

- [Wine Quality Data (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- Contains physicochemical properties of red wine and their quality ratings.

## Steps Performed

1. Data loading and preview
2. Data cleaning (nulls, duplicates)
3. Target variable analysis
4. Correlation analysis
5. Distribution and visualization (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, etc.)
6. Group statistics by wine quality

## How to Run

1. Download `winequality-red.csv` and place it in this folder.
2. Open `WineQuality.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells in order.

## Key Findings

- The dataset is imbalanced (most wines rated 5-7).
- Alcohol and volatile acidity are important for wine quality.
- Some features are skewed.
