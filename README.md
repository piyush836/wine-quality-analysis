# Problem
Understand which physicochemical properties of red wine influence quality ratings, and identify pattern that can help assess wine quality objectively.

# Data Source
Public Wine Quality(Red Wine) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, provided as a structured CSV file.

# Final Output
Exploratory insights and feature relationships that expalin variations in wine quality ratings and guide future predictive modeling.

# Where  this fits in a Data Science Pipeline
This project represents the exploratory data analysis (EDA) stage, helping validate data quality, uncover pattern, and inform feature selection before model training.

# Wine Quality EDA
This project explores the Wine Quality (Red Wine) dataset using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

## Dataset

- [Wine Quality Data (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- Contains physicochemical properties of red wine and their quality ratings.

## Steps Performed

1. Data loading and preview
2. Data cleaning (nulls, duplicates)
3. Target variable analysis
4. Correlation analysis
5. Distribution and visualization (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, etc.)
6. Group statistics by wine quality

## How to Run

1. Download `winequality-red.csv` and place it in this folder.
2. Open `WineQuality.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells in order.

## Key Findings

- The dataset is imbalanced (most wines rated 5-7).
- Alcohol and volatile acidity are important for wine quality.
- Some features are skewed.
